# Discord-HvZ

A Discord bot written in Python designed to help run a Humans vs. Zombies game. Information about HvZ: https://humansvszombies.org/  
This is *not* a typical Discord bot that runs on many servers at once: you run it for your own server.  
In theory, this gives you extra control.

For *lots* more information, go to the documentation site:

## [Documentation](https://conner-anderson.github.io/discord-hvz-docs/)

## Version 0.2.0 Released!

This is the second official release and includes *major* changes from the previous alpha release.  
While this is no longer called an "alpha" release, any version number below 1.0.0 may have breaking changes.  
Read the release information for details on how to update.

#### Important Changes:
 - Changed the commands to Slash Commands
 - Implemented more robust customization
 - Rewrote the fan-favorite feature of the tag tree and added an auto-generating graph that tracks player numbers
 - Created multiple install methods
 - Wrote an extensive documentation site
 - Updated and improved many things under the hood



## Helping with Development
The biggest way to help improve the bot is to submit bugs and features requests here on GitHub, 
and to email me with anecdotes about how your HvZ game went. If you want to collaborate in development, contact me and we'll talk about it!
