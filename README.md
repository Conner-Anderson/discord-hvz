# Discord-HvZ

A Discord bot written in Python designed to help run a Humans vs. Zombies game. Information about HvZ: https://humansvszombies.org/  
This is *not* a typical Discord bot that runs on many servers at once: you run it for your own server.  
In theory, this gives you extra control.

For *lots* more information, go to the documentation site:

## [Documentation](https://conner-anderson.github.io/discord-hvz-docs/)

## Version 0.2.1 Released

This is the third official release and includes moderate changes based on real game testing at LeTourneau University. See the changelog in [Releases](https://github.com/Conner-Anderson/discord-hvz/releases).



## Helping with Development
The biggest way to help improve the bot is to submit bugs and features requests here on GitHub, 
and to email me with anecdotes about how your HvZ game went. If you want to collaborate in development, contact me and we'll talk about it!
